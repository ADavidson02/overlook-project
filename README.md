# Gametime Starter Kit

## Fork This Repo

Within your group, decide on one person to have the project repository (repo) on their GitHub account. Then, that person should "fork" this repo. On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

After one person has forked the repo, everyone should clone down the forked repo. Since you don't want to name your project "gametime-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Where to Add Your Code

You have to be very intentional with where you add your feature code. This repo uses a tool called [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to combine many JavaScript files into one big file. Webpack enables you to have many, separate JavaScript files to keep your code organized and readable. Webpack expects all of your code files to be in a specific place, or else it doesn't know how to combine them all behind the scenes.

**Create all of your feature code files in the `src` directory.**

Since code is separated into multiple files, you need to use the `import` and `export` syntax to share code across file.

Here is a video that walks through some information about [import and export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3oSWwapPKQ). There are a lot of resources out there about `import` and `export`, and resources will sometimes call them `ES6 modules`.

## How to View Your Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `box-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your game_, then you can consider deploying your game to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your game to the web. More information about how to do this on the way...
